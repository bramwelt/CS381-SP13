  Question:
      What is the new type of the function sem and why can the
      function definition be simplified to have this type?

  Answer:
       The new type of sem is 'Prog -> D' where type D = Stack -> Stack.
       type D can be simplified to no longer contain Maybe Stacks,
       because the type checker handles all TypeErrors.

{----------------------- Exercise 3 -------------------------}

{- (a) Consider the functions f and g, which are given by the
    following two function definitions.  -}

f x y = if null x then [y] else x
g x y = if not (null x) then [] else [y]

{- (1) What are the types of f and g?
       f :: [a] -> a -> [a]
       g :: [a] -> b -> [b]

   (2) Explain why the functions have these types.
       Since f will return either [y] or x, and x is a list, the elements
       of x have to be of the same type as y. This is because, to the
       best of our knowledge) Haskell can't return two different types
       from a function.

       While similar to f, g will return either [] or [y]. The subtle
       difference here is that y now has no relation to x, since a list
       is a phantom type. This make Haskell assume the second argument
       to g is not the same type as the first.

   (3) Which type is more general?
       Because both f and g will work with any types they are both
       general, but one could make the argument that because g works
       with more than one type, it is more general.

   (4) Why do f and g have different types?
       f and g have different types because of the magic of Haskell type
       inference.

{- (b) Find a (simple) definition for a function h that has the
      following type. -}

h :: [b] -> [(a, b)] -> [b]
h b _ = b

{- (c) Find a (simple) definition for a function k that has the 
       following type.

   k :: (a -> b) -> ((a -> b) -> a) -> b

   We can not find a (simple) definition for function k, as there is no
   way in Haskell to pattern match a function and its parameters at the
   same time. Also since the function signature only defines b in the
   terms of being the return type of another function, we can not deduce
   anything about how b should be represented.

  (d) Can you define a function of type a -> b?
      If yes, explain your definition. If not, explain why it is
      so difficult.

      No. Defining a function of type a -> b requires knowing something
      about type b. Since we don't have that knowledge, we can not
      define how something of type b should be represented. Anything we
      might use would end up restricting what b might be, thus it would
      not be of any type.

      We could write:
          j :: a -> b
          j = j

      But this is a circular definition and will never terminate, thus
      we have not truly defined anything at all.
